Simulations were carried out in Matlab
- The main script is `SurvivalCurves.m’ and we run section by section
- It uses `tumorMLE.m’ for solving MLE parameter fits
- We use `relDE_logistic.m’ for our survival curve ode

Our code is also available in Python, in the file titled `Virtual Mice Code.ipynb’
